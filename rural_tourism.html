										<h4>What is Rural Tourism</h4>

										<strong>Rural tourism in India:</strong> 
										<p>India’s heart lies in its villages. Every rural community is steeped in folklore and indigenous craft. The traditional way of life will greatly enrich the visitor’s experience. Our rural experience lets you slow down and experience life away from the fast-moving city streets with chances to meet villagers. It will reconnect your soul to the soil,</p>

										<strong>Authentic Rural Experience</strong>
										<p>With increasing interest in Rural and indigenous tourism, many places are trying to offer authentic experience. This brings us to the question of what is authentic rural experience?</p>
										<strong>Backstage instead of front row seats</strong>
										<p>Think of this experience like a Yakshagana performance. The front stage is where all of the excitement happens.  A front row seat promises you a good experience. However, this is not enough for many people and they want to make their way back stage and see what it looks like behind the scenes. They want to know the stories of the artist and the art. This can be the same for tourists as well. They may enjoy their experience in the “front stage” world but wish to travel to the “back stage” and see what the people and culture are really like.  We facilitate this to happen.</p> 

										<p>The problem with having an authentic experience when traveling is that everyone has a different opinion of what authentic is. This makes it hard to create rural tourism experiences that will please everyone.</p> 
										<p>We have travelled a lot and we feel that authenticity comes in two forms, goods and experiences. Goods are the things that can be physically bought, such as pottery, paintings and other agricultural commodities that can be physically brought home with you.</p> 

										<p>An experience could include meeting a farmer, a priest, seeing an artist in action or having a meal in the house of the local person. Even a simple experience like playing rural games with the community kids, drawing water from the well, swimming in the rivers, all these will connect us to nature and help us destress and go back to cities rejuvenated.</p> 


										<strong>Forging Relationships to Make an Experience “Authentic”.</strong>

										<p>Forging relationships with the local population would help make the experience more authentic. Each one of us has a “story” that is unique.  We encourage you to share this with the local person. It could be the farmer who grows pineapples or it could be the lady who sells pineapples for a living. Everyone has an authentic story and knowing their stories and forging relationships will definitely give you an authentic experience.</p>

										<p>The rural people aren’t concerned with the tourists and can give you valuable insight into their culture and society.</p>

										<p>We are like the bridge and we help you in forging relationship with the locals so that you can have an authentic experience and can be a guest to Banavasi instead of being g a guest to the host alone.</p>

										<h4>Hospitality & Cuisine</h4>
										<p>It’s an eco-tourism destination which is rustic and rural. While tourism has run rampant and largely uncontrolled in the Western Ghats in recent years, here we are trying to create a simple sustainable model that benefits the community while leaving minimal impact on environment.</p> 
										<p>We try to provide tourists with a real cultural experience while enjoying nature. There is no TV in rooms as we encourage you to be in outdoors enjoying various activities like bird watching, Nature walk, Heritage walk etc. We depend on the Grid for Electricity and don’t have generators.</p>
										<p>We have western toilets, clean linen and 10 rooms.</p>

										<p>We also have dormitory and can accommodate a small group.</p>

										<p>We have the facility to pitch 4-6 tents in our campus as well.</p>

										(some pictures of rooms / tents can come here). 
										<h4>Cuisine:</h4>
										<p>When in Rome, do as the Romans do….
										Come to Banavasi for its varied cuisine. “Khanavalis” or small eateries in Banavasi serve up hot, delicious food with a warm smile. There are several breads made of rice, jowar and corn as well as rice served with a variety of sweet, sour, pungent and spicy curries and sauces. Accompanying the meal is a wide range of fresh powders and chutneys made of lentils, chillies, tamarind, oil cake.</p>

										<p>We make and serve the local cuisine.  We encourage you to experience the local vegetarian cuisine. Part of the experience is to go to the house of a selected person and share his meal and his stories.</p>
										<p>We shall serve the best Pineapple along with your breakfast.</p>
										<p>There is something profoundly satisfying about sharing a meal. Eating together, breaking bread together, is one of the oldest and most fundamentally unifying of human experiences.

										<h4>Our  Aim and Approach towards Sustainable Rural Tourism</h4>

										<p>We run the tourism initiate successfully In Banavasi.. It is a hybrid model where, our NGO GDSET will look after the sustainability / scalability / replicable aspects of the concept.  GDSET looks after community development and environmental protection as well. Outdoor World Sustainable Solutions will look after tourism aspects.</p>
										 
										<p>Tourism has a ripple down effect, however we need to be inclusive, to include, artists, temples, marginalized farmers, small entrepreneurs, traders, local NGO’s etc. This will ensure that there is an equitable benefit to the community because of the tourist inflow. When tourism help the entire spectrum of the society, it brings a pride about the place amongst the people and also goes a long way in keeping the place neat and clean.</p>
										 
										<p>Sustainable tourism also brings back focus on the culture of the place instead of hedonistic pursuits of the majority of travelers.
										People are going to the Western Ghats and instead of enjoying the culture there; they are destroying the culture there. Today people go there to “Wine and Dine” only.</p>
										 
										<p>I feel more confident than ever that the power to save the planet rests with the individual consumer. - Denis Hayes</p>
										 
										(pictures of craft people/ Gudigar can come here)
										 
										<p>An alternative model like the one we have demonstrated allows travelers to be immersed in local rituals and routine of the villagers, taking away not only pretty photos but also shared memories of unique experiences. For example, one can go to the farm with the villagers, or the pineapple factory to work for a day, or take part in the happenings around the village. One can learn Chitara painting from the artist or just spend a day with the artist. One can buy from the local artist, who specialize in wood, clay, pith etc</p>
										 
										<p>We also offer local cuisine e.g. Havyaka food, lingayat food, Gowda family food etc. The travelers will also understand the communities better this way.</p>
