							<h2>What is Rural Tourism?</h2>

							<h3>Rural tourism in India:</h3> 
							<p>India’s heart lies in its villages. Every rural community is steeped in folklore and indigenous craft. The traditional way of life will greatly enrich the visitor’s experience. Our rural experience lets you slow down and experience life away from the fast-moving city streets with chances to meet villagers. It will reconnect your soul to the soil.</p>
							<div class="hst_arch">
							<img src="images/rural_tourism/what_is_rural_tourism/farm_volunteering.jpg" alt="farm_volunteering" class="img-responsive" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
							</div>

							<h3>Authentic Rural Experience</h3>
							<p>With increasing interest in Rural and indigenous tourism, many places are trying to offer authentic experience. This brings us to the question of what is authentic rural experience?</p>
							<h3>Backstage instead of front row seats</h3>
							<p>Think of this experience like a Yakshagana performance. The front stage is where all of the excitement happens.  A front row seat promises you a good experience. However, this is not enough for many people and they want to make their way back stage and see what it looks like behind the scenes. They want to know the stories of the artist and the art. This can be the same for tourists as well. They may enjoy their experience in the “front stage” world but wish to travel to the “back stage” and see what the people and culture are really like.  We facilitate this to happen.</p> 

							<p>The problem with having an authentic experience when traveling is that everyone has a different opinion of what authentic is. This makes it hard to create rural tourism experiences that will please everyone. 
							We have travelled a lot and we feel that authenticity comes in two forms, goods and experiences. Goods are the things that can be physically bought, such as pottery, paintings and other agricultural commodities that can be physically brought home with you.</p> 

							<p>An experience could include meeting a farmer, a priest, seeing an artist in action or having a meal in the house of the local person. Even a simple experience like playing rural games with the community kids, drawing water from the well, swimming in the rivers, all these will connect us to nature and help us destress and go back to cities rejuvenated.</p> 
							<div class="hst_arch"><img src="images/rural_tourism/what_is_rural_tourism/cycle.jpg" alt="cycle" class="img-responsive" onclick="window.open(this.src)"></div>


							<h3>Forging Relationships to Make an Experience “Authentic”.</h3>

							<p>Forging relationships with the local population would help make the experience more authentic. Each one of us has a “story” that is unique.  We encourage you to share this with the local person. It could be the farmer who grows pineapples or it could be the lady who sells pineapples for a living. Everyone has an authentic story and knowing their stories and forging relationships will definitely give you an authentic experience.</p>

								<img src="images/rural_tourism/what_is_rural_tourism/festivals.jpg" alt="festivals" class="img-responsive" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
							</div>
							<p>The rural people aren’t concerned with the tourists and can give you valuable insight into their culture and society.</p>

							<p>We are like the bridge and we help you in forging relationship with the locals so that you can have an authentic experience and can be a guest to Banavasi instead of being a guest to the host alone.</p>

					  		<h2>Hospitality & Cuisine</h2>
					  		<p>It’s an eco-tourism destination which is rustic and rural. While tourism has run rampant and largely uncontrolled in the Western Ghats in recent years, here we are trying to create a simple sustainable model that benefits the community while leaving minimal impact on environment.</p>

					  		<h2>Our  Aim and Approach towards Sustainable Rural Tourism</h2>
					  		 
					  		<p>We run the tourism initiate successfully In Banavasi.. It is a hybrid model where, our NGO GDSET will look after the sustainability / scalability / replicable aspects of the concept.  GDSET looks after community development and environmental protection as well. Outdoor World Sustainable Solutions will look after tourism aspects.</p>
					  		 
					  		<p>Tourism has a ripple down effect, however we need to be inclusive, to include, artists, temples, marginalized farmers, small entrepreneurs, traders, local NGO’s etc. This will ensure that there is an equitable benefit to the community because of the tourist inflow. When tourism help the entire spectrum of the society, it brings a pride about the place amongst the people and also goes a long way in keeping the place neat and clean.</p>
					  		 
					  		<p>Sustainable tourism also brings back focus on the culture of the place instead of hedonistic pursuits of the majority of travelers.
					  		People are going to the Western Ghats and instead of enjoying the culture there; they are destroying the culture there. Today people go there to “Wine and Dine” only.</p>
					  		 
					  		<p>I feel more confident than ever that the power to save the planet rests with the individual consumer. - Denis Hayes</p>
					  		 
					  		(pictures of craft people/ Gudigar can come here)
					  		 
					  		<p>An alternative model like the one we have demonstrated allows travelers to be immersed in local rituals and routine of the villagers, taking away not only pretty photos but also shared memories of unique experiences. For example, one can go to the farm with the villagers, or the pineapple factory to work for a day, or take part in the happenings around the village. One can learn Chitara painting from the artist or just spend a day with the artist. One can buy from the local artist, who specialize in wood, clay, pith etc</p>
					  		 
					  		<p>We also offer local cuisine e.g. Havyaka food, lingayat food, Gowda family food etc. The travelers will also understand the communities better this way.</p>

					  		<p>The most visited attraction is the Madhukeshwara Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. With a blend of different architectural styles, the temple provides a real treat to the admirers of architecture, apart from the devout. Striking features include the seven-foot huge Nandi idol made of a single stone, splendid monolithic stone works like the stone couch and the Triloka Mantapa depicting heaven, earth and the nether world, amongst others. Several other temples dot the village.</p>

					  		<h3>Trial 3 Trek and Birding trip.</h3>
					  		<p>If you are interested in bird watching, then Gudavi Bird Sanctuary, a small seasoned lake surrounded by moist deciduous forest, 12 kms away from Banavasi would be a riveting experience, this can be clubbed with a picnic lunch and a trek to Chandraguthi.</p> 
					  		<p>Chandragutti Fort is a historical place that is surrounded by natural beauty on all sides. The fort is located atop a hill. Chandragutti Fort is an ancient structure. The fort was under the control of the Kadambas of Banavasi, according to an inscription that dates back to 1396 A.D. A trek to the Chandragutti Fort is a delight for trekkers.  It is a moderate trek and can be completed in 3 -4 hours leisurely. The route to the fort passes through a dense forest and offers the opportunity to trekkers to watch various kinds of trees and plants. Stone steps leading from the forest to the fort make the climb easier. But it is the view from the top that is breath-taking. Standing on the highest point of the fort and having a look at the blanket of greenery below is a surreal experience. It is a quiet place with a gentle breeze always flowing. The fort is the perfect location to relax, away from the din and hustle of city life and pollution.</p>
