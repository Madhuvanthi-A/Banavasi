										<h4>Who are we?</h4>
										 
										<strong>B.C.Kiran</strong>

										<p>B.C.Kiran, hails from a small village in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. His passion is travel, community development and volunteering. He spent over 12 years in mainstream tourism and realised that neither the community nor the environment is benefitted by mainstream tourism.</p>

										<p>He quit his carrier to become a social entrepreneur. His goal was to combine travel with Individual and Corporate Social Responsibility.</p>

										<p>With this in mind, he started working with the villagers in Banavasi. It’s the oldest town in Karnataka and has a documented history of 2000 yrs.  Work started slowly and steadily on responsible and sustainable tourism. It was not easy. The first year just went in winning the trust and heart of the villagers. Later along with the villagers an alternative model was created where people from Urban area, could come stay with the community and have a meaningful holiday.</p>

										<p>With these learning’s, Kiran and his team are in the process of starting another venture in Chickmagalur with the intention of  impacting more to the local community and environment around.</p>

										<h4>Our Story…….How it all began</h4>
										<span>B.C.KIRAN
											Each one of us has our own evolution of life, and each one of us goes through different tests which are unique and challenging. But certain things are common. And we do learn things from each other's experience. On a spiritual journey, we all have the same destination. A. R. Rahman</span>
											<p>It all started way back in 2009. I was working in Club Mahindra. There were three powerful instances that made me introspect and change the course of my life.</p>
										<div>
											<strong>First  Episode:-</strong>
											 
											<p>As the Sales Manager for Club Mahindra, my task was to get more "nonmembers" to come and stay in Mahindra Resorts. Club Mahindra had great resorts in Coorg, Pondicherry, Ooty etc. I started targeting the school segment and I was fairly successful in getting good schools to come for excursions to the resorts.</p> 
											 
											<p>I was happy that we had tapped a new segment. I also got the opportunity to spend time with the Kids. I love kids and like to spend time with them. These kids would typically get to stay in good rooms, eat good food, do some fun activities and go back to Bangalore.</p> 
											 
											<p>On one such excursion a school kid asked me "where is the tree that rice grows on"? And that he would like to see it. This really shocked me and it was the moment of truth where I started questioning myself about what value addition I am doing for the kids? At the same time the interactions with the teachers / Head mistress/ Principal etc made me realize that there was a huge gap in educational system. The kids did not get exposed to any farming/ rural life / nature / culture / history etc. All their leanings were text book learning.</p>
											 
											 <p>I started to add local experiences to make it educational for the kids on their excursions like plantation walk, history tour etc. However, there is a limitation to what I could do because I was working for a hospitality company whose main revenue came from rooms, food and in-house activities. Our business was not about learning or educating these kids.</p>
											 
											<p>I felt there was a need to have a place where kids can be exposed to nature, farming, sustainable practices etc</p>
											 
											<p>"In the end we will conserve only what we love; wewill love only what we understand; and we will understand only what we are taught." (Baba Dioum, 1968.)</p>
											 
											 
											<strong>Second Episode: -</strong>
											 
											 
											<p>The fate of the living planet is the most important issue facing mankind. - Gaylord Nelson
											 
											<p>The other episode that impacted my career was related to what was happening in my home town. I hail from the Western Ghats of Karnataka. Western Ghats are the life line of south India. This is true of Karnataka as well. Most of the rivers originate from the Western Ghats, be it Cauvery, Hemavathi etc.</p> 
											 
											<p>Tourism is developing in the Ghats. Many people come from Bangalore and started making homestays / resorts etc. Huge trees were cut down, Big Buildings started coming up. The towns are no longer the same. This is taking a toll on the Fauna and flora of this place. The community has not developed around these tourism projects. The environment around these tourism projects are getting degraded and depleting at a fast pace. This has interfered in the pattern of rain as well.  Coorg has been destroyed by tourism, Tourism cannot be stopped in Mudigere (my home town) ... The question is can there be alternative model to the mainstream?</p>
											 
											<p>These two episodes made me feel that there is a need for alternative models of tourism where everyone benefits. I quit my corporate career. Started a firm called "Outdoor World Sustainable Tourism". I tied up with ecologin a start up in similar space in Chennai. ecologin was founded by alumni of IIT and IIM. The learning was great. We had fun. We did excursions and tours into remote places and often stayed with tribals, farmers etc. I learnt about community development as well.</p>
											 
											<p>In the ecologin journey, we felt that we need to create a sustainable model for tourism.   An exemplar which has to demonstrate evidently that there can be economy thru ecology. We need to show that such a model can benefit both the community in the village and also have a positive impact on the environment around.  A model where there is sustainable solutions like water harvesting, water recycling, waste management, etc. A model that can help preserve our culture, nature, crafts etc.</p>
											 
											<p>Plans to protect air and water, wilderness and wildlife are in fact plans to protect man. - Stewart Udall</p>
											 
											 
											 
											<strong>Third Episode:-</strong>
											 
											<p>In 2011, there was a conference on Sustainable tourism in the Western Ghats. This was in Sirsi. On one of the field trips we were taken to Banavasi to show how UNDP project has failed. It was a case study. UNDP has created some infrastructure in Banavasi. However, it had totally failed to serve any purpose. Lakhs of rupees were spent, but there was not even drinking water available at this facility. It was being used as a cheap lodge for a " dirty weekend" or shut down most of the time.</p>
											 
											<p>In Banavasi I saw the opportunity to create a sustainable form of tourism Initiative. It was a perfect place for me to create what I had dreamt of.</p>
											 
											 <p>So, I approached the Temple committee and other committee that were entrusted to run this place, and offered a "WIN - WIN" proposal to run this place. It took me one full year to just get them to trust me.</p>
											 
											 
											<strong>Fourth Episode- Volunteering and CSR</strong>
											 
											<p>Since most of the weekends I would travel to Banavasi, it took a toll on my business in Bangalore and I was forced to look for a job. I was grateful to get a job in Intel Technologies. My job was to look after the volunteering requirements of 4500 employees spread across India. Here I learnt about CSR and the power of volunteering.</p>
											 
											<p>Now we had another angle for sustainable tourism…. Volunteering and CSR</p>
											 
											<strong>Outdoor World Sustainable Tourism -Our Approach towards Sustainable Rural Tourism</strong>
											 
											<p>We run the tourism initiate successfully In Banavasi.. It will be a hybrid model where, our NGO GDSET will look after the sustainability / scalability / replicable aspects of the concept. Outdoor World Sustainable Solutions will look after tourism aspects.</p>
											 
											<p>Tourism has a ripple down effect, however we need to be inclusive, to include, artists, temples, marginalized farmers, small entrepreneurs, traders, local NGO’s etc. This will ensure that there is an equitable benefit to the community because of the tourist inflow.</p>
											 
											<p>Sustainable tourism also brings back focus on the culture of the place instead of hedonistic pursuits of the majority of travelers.
											People are going to the Western Ghats and instead of enjoying the culture there; they are destroying the culture there. Today people go there to “Wine and Dine” only.</p>
											 
											<ul><li>I feel more confident than ever that the power to save the planet rests with the individual consumer. - Denis Hayes</li></ul>
											 
											( pictures of craft people/ gudigar can come here)
											 
											<p>An alternative model like the one we have demonstrated allows travelers to be immersed in local rituals and routine of the villagers, taking away not only pretty photos but also shared memories of unique experiences. For example, one can go to the farm with the villagers, or the pineapple factory to work for a day, or take part in the happenings around the village. One can learn Chitara painting from the artist or just spend a day with the artist. One can buy from the local artist, who specialize in wood, clay, pith etc</p>
											 
											<p>We also offer local cuisine e.g. Havyaka food, lingayat food, Gowda family food etc. The travelers will also understand the communities better this way.</p>
											 
											( Picture of cuisine or guest house eating )
											 
											 
											 “Don't Just<br>

											Don't just learn, experience.<br>
											Don't just read, absorb.<br>
											Don't just change, transform.<br>
											Don't just relate, advocate.<br>
											Don't just promise, prove.<br>
											Don't just criticize, encourage.<br>
											Don't just think, ponder.<br>
											Don't just take, give.<br>
											Don't just see, feel.<br>
											Don’t just dream, do. <br>
											Don't just hear, listen.<br>
											Don't just talk, act.<br>
											Don't just tell, show.<br>
											Don't just exist, live.” <br>
