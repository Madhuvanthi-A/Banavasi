					  		<h2>History & Archeology</h2>
							<p>Existing since 4000 BC, the period of <a href="http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/mythology/mahabharat/">Mahabharata</a>, Banavasi was known as &#39Vanavasaka&#39. Greek geographer Ptomlemy mentioned Banavasi as &#39Banousi&#39 in his famous book in 1st century A.D. It was called &#39Jayanthipura&#39 or &#39Vaijayanthipura&#39 during the Kadamba period in the early 4th century A.D. Banavasi is the oldest town in the Karnataka state. Huen Tsang the Chinese traveler-monk who was in India between 630-644 C.E, visited Konkanapura called Konkanapulo (referred in Chinese scripts) or Banavasi.</p>

							<p>Banavasi is mentioned in the Mahabharata epic. The Buddhist work Mahavamsa states that Emperor Ashoka sent missionaries to Banavasi. It was part of Shatvahana Empire for centuries and stone inscriptions, coins and brick structures of their period were discovered in Banavasi.</p>

							<p>The great Kannada poet <a href="http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=305">Pampa</a> was so much enamored of this place that he exclaimed that he wished to be born as a petty cuckoo or bee in the land of Banavasi!</p>
							

							<p>We are reminded of foreigners mentioning Banavasi. Greek geographer Ptolemy's (1st century C.E), Banavasi is identified with this place. <a href="http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/itihas/huen-tsang.htm">Huen Tsang</a> the Chinese monk and <a href="http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/itihas/alberuni.htm">Alberuni</a> the Arab scholar also mention it. Tradition speaks of <a href="http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/art/zha/meghadut_31137.htm">Kalidasa</a> the greatest Indian poet, having visited Banavasi, as an ambassador of Gupta kings, and the beautiful description of nature in his love lyric <a href="http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=772">Meghaduta</a>, pertains to Banavasi.</p>

							<p>The <a href="http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/chalukya/ihole.htm">Aihole</a> inscription of Pulakeshi II calls Banavasi as "Jaldurga" or water fort. The Varada river flows around the town on three sides. Perhaps the fort was surrounded by the fourth side as well, in ancient times, when the river was mighty.</p>

							<h3>Kadambas</h3>
							<p>The Kadambas are considered the earliest indigenous rulers of Karnataka. Its founder was Mayurasharma and its most powerful ruler was Kakusthavarma. The Kadamba name is attributed to the Kadamba tree that was grown near the place where the empire was founded. Kadambas ruled for almost 200 years before Chalukyas took over their empire, but some minor branches of Kadambas ruled Hanagal, Goa and other regions till 14th century.</p> 

							<p>One of their earliest inscriptions, the Talagunda inscription of Santivarma (450) gives what may be the most possible cause for the emergence of the Kadamba kingdom. It states that Mayurasharma had been a native of Talagunda, (in present day Shimoga district) and his family got its name from the Kadamba tree that grew near his home. The inscription narrates how Mayurasharma proceeded to Kanchi in 345 along with his guru and grandfather Veerasarma to prosecute his Vedic studies at a Ghatika (school). There, owing to some misunderstanding between him and a Pallava guard at an Ashvasanstha (a place of horse sacrifice), a quarrel arose in which the guard humiliated Mayurasharma.</p>

							<p>In high rage, the Brahmana discontinued his studies, left Kanchi, swearing vengeance on the impudent Pallavas and took to arms. He collected a faithful group of followers and routed Pallava .After a prolonged period of low intensity warfare against the Pallavas and other smaller kings such as the Brihad-Banas of Kolar region he proclaimed independence. Unable to contain him, the Pallavas had to accept his sovereignty. The Talagunda inscription of 450 states the Mayurasharma had been the progenitor of the kingdom. The inscription gives a graphic description of the happenings at Kanchi, "That the hand dexterous in grasping the Kusha (grass), fuel and stones, ladle, melted butter and the oblation vessel, unsheathed a flaming sword, eager to conquer the earth."</p>

							<p>Thus, the first native kingdom of Karnataka arose from an act of righteous indignation, the Pallava King Skandavarman condescending to recognize the growing might of the Kadambas south of the Malaprabha river as a sovereign power. The fact that Mayurasharma had to travel to distant Kanchi for Vedic studies gives an indication that Vedic lore had been quite rudimentary in the region at that time.</p>

							<h2><u>Archaeology</u></h2>
							<h3>Gudnapura Ruins</h3>
							<p>The recently discovered Gudnapur inscription states that Virasarma had been Mauryasharma's grandfather and preceptor, and his father, Bandhushena, developed the character of a Kshatriya.  This is preserved and can be seen in Gudnapura, which is about 10 minutes drive from Banavasi.</p>

							<p>Coins with Kannada legends have been discovered from the rule of the Kadambas. Kadambas had been the first rulers to use Kannada as an additional official administrative language, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription. Some artifacts can be seen preserved today at the temple where there is a make shift museum.</p>

							<h3>Madhukeshwara Temple</h3>
							<div class="hst_arch">
							<img src="images/banavasi/history_and_archeology/history_400_ratha1.jpg" alt="history_400_ratha1" class="img-responsive" style="width: 49.33%;
    							float: right !important;" onclick="window.open(this.src)"></div>
							<p>Their Talagunda inscription starts with an invocation of Lord Shiva while the Halmidi and Banavasi inscriptions start with an invocation of Lord Vishnu. They built the Madhukesvara temple, considered their family deity.</p>
							<p>This temple is still intact and there are prayer and pooja done here every day. It probably is one of the oldest monuments where worshiping the god happens everyday without fail for about 2000 years.  The original Linga in the sanctum Santorum is swayam udbhava, “born by itself” and this probably dates back to period earlier than the Kadambas.</p>
							

							<h3>Kadamba Shikara</h3>
							<!--div class="hst_arch">
							<img src="images/banavasi/history_and_archeology/history_400_Crop.jpg" alt="history_400_ratha1" class="img-responsive" style="width: 49.33%;
    							float: right !important;" onclick="window.open(this.src)"></div-->
							<p>The Kadamba style has distinguishing characteristics, including a few things in common with the Chalukyan and the Pallava styles. They drew from the architectural tradition of the Satavahanas. Shikara, called Kadamba Shikara, constitutes the most prominent feature of their architecture.
							
							The Shikara has a pyramid shape and rises in steps, without any decoration, with a Kalasha at the top. Some of their temples also used perforated screen windows. In architecture and sculpture, the Kadambas contributed to the foundation of the later Chalukya-Hoysala style.</p>
							<p>The Sonda kings are credited with some major additions including the mantapa in front of the Parvati Temple. By far, their most eye-catching contribution is the ornate monolithic granite structure called the stone cot. This cot was donated to the temple by the Sonda king Raghunatha in 1628. Many of the shrines lining the outer walls of the temple are also Sonda additions. Among these are shrines dedicated to the ashtadikpalakas, the guardians of the eight directions.</p>

					  		<p>Lying in the lap of Malnad&#39s forests, Banavasi has a lot to offer to a person who is looking at appreciating nature. The Varada River gently flows on three sides of Banavasi.</p>

					  		<p>There is the <strong>Pampavana,</strong> a garden in Banavasi named after the great poet, where legend has it that he wrote many of his verses.  It&#39s a treat to be here early morning when mist still kisses the grass and the trees.</p>

					  		<p><h3>Vashita thirtha:-</h3> It&#39s a pond filled with lotus and has steps to sit down and think about the era gone by. There are many birds there, some in the water bodies and some in the trees in the groove.</p>

					  		<p>Adikavi Pampa highly spoke of that kingdom in his writings, as indicated by his famous quotes on Banavasi: Aaramkushamittodam nenevudenna manam banavasi deshamam (I shall cherish the sweet memories of Banavasi even when tortured), Maridumbiyagi mEN Kogileyagi puttuvudu nandanadol Banavasi deshadol (As a bee or as nightingale should one born here in this beautiful country of Banavasi).</p>

					  		<p>It is believed that the Kadamba kings patronised art and there were a lot of artist around this area. Even today you can see and meet artists who work with stone, clay, sandal wood and pith. All these are traditional artsists and their knowledge is passed on from one generation to the other.</p>
